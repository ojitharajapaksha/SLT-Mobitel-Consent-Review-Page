# 🔧 Railway path-to-regexp Error - FIXED

## Problem
You were getting this error when deploying to Railway:
```
TypeError: Missing parameter name at 1:
at lexer (/app/node_modules/path-to-regexp/dist/index.js:73)
```

## Root Cause
**Express v5.1.0** has breaking changes and compatibility issues with routing that cause `path-to-regexp` errors during deployment.

## ✅ Solution Applied

### 1. Downgraded Express to Stable Version
**Changed:**
```json
"express": "^5.1.0"  // ❌ Unstable, causes path-to-regexp errors
```
**To:**
```json
"express": "^4.19.2"  // ✅ Stable, widely supported
```

### 2. Added Better Error Handling
- Route loading with try-catch blocks
- Better startup logging
- MongoDB connection error handling that doesn't crash the server

### 3. Removed Deprecated MongoDB Options
**Removed deprecated options:**
- `useNewUrlParser: true`
- `useUnifiedTopology: true`

**Modern connection:**
```javascript
mongoose.connect(process.env.MONGO_URI)
```

### 4. Added Railway Configuration
Created `railway.json` for better deployment configuration:
```json
{
  "build": { "builder": "NIXPACKS" },
  "deploy": {
    "startCommand": "npm start",
    "restartPolicyType": "ON_FAILURE",
    "restartPolicyMaxRetries": 10
  }
}
```

## 🧪 Verification
Server now starts successfully with:
```
✅ Routes loaded successfully
✅ API routes mounted successfully
🚀 TMF632 Party API running on port 3000
✅ MongoDB connected successfully
```

## 📋 Next Steps for Railway Deployment

1. **Commit and push these changes to GitHub**
2. **Deploy to Railway** - the path-to-regexp error should be gone
3. **Test these endpoints:**
   - `https://your-railway-url.up.railway.app/` (API info)
   - `https://your-railway-url.up.railway.app/health` (health check)
   - `https://your-railway-url.up.railway.app/health/detailed` (detailed status)

## 🛡️ Prevention
- Always use stable versions of Express (4.x) for production
- Express 5.x is still experimental and has breaking changes
- Test locally before deploying to catch these issues early

The 502 errors and path-to-regexp issues should now be completely resolved!
