## ðŸš€ Deployment Steps

### Step 1: Setup MongoDB (5 minutes)
- [ ] Go to https://cloud.mongodb.com/
- [ ] Create a free cluster
- [ ] Create a database user with username/password
- [ ] Add your IP to whitelist (or use 0.0.0.0/0 for all IPs)
- [ ] Copy the connection string
- [ ] Replace `<username>`, `<password>`, and database name in the connection string

### Step 2: Deploy Backend to Railway (5 minutes)
- [ ] Go to https://railway.app/new
- [ ] Connect your GitHub repository
- [ ] Set root directory to: `Party Management API`
- [ ] Add environment variables:
  - [ ] `NODE_ENV=production`
  - [ ] `PORT=3000`
  - [ ] `MONGO_URI=your_mongodb_connection_string`
- [ ] Deploy and wait for completion
- [ ] **ðŸ“‹ Copy your Railway URL:** ________________________

### Step 3: Test Backend (2 minutes)
- [ ] Visit: `YOUR_RAILWAY_URL/health`
- [ ] Should see: `{"status":"OK","timestamp":"..."}`
- [ ] If not working, check Railway logs

### Step 4: Deploy Frontend to Vercel (5 minutes)
- [ ] Go to https://vercel.com/new
- [ ] Connect your GitHub repository
- [ ] Leave root directory blank
- [ ] Add environment variables (replace YOUR_RAILWAY_URL with actual URL from Step 2):
  - [ ] `VITE_API_BASE_URL=YOUR_RAILWAY_URL`
  - [ ] `VITE_HEALTH_URL=YOUR_RAILWAY_URL/health`
  - [ ] `VITE_TMF_API_BASE_URL=YOUR_RAILWAY_URL/tmf-api/party/v5`
  - [ ] `VITE_CONSENT_API_URL=YOUR_RAILWAY_URL/tmf-api/consent/v1`
- [ ] Deploy and wait for completion

### Step 5: Test Complete Application (3 minutes)
- [ ] Visit your Vercel URL
- [ ] Go through the flow: Consent â†’ Party Selection â†’ Sign Up
- [ ] Try creating both Individual and Organization accounts
- [ ] Check browser console for any errors
- [ ] If errors, check that environment variables are correct
